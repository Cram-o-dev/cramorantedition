# Pokémon Yellow: Cramorant Edition

A ROM hack of Pokemon Yellow which replaces Pikachu with Cramorant! Many other major and minor changes have also been made to provide (in my opinion) an overall better way to play Yellow and the Generation I Pokemon games. The goal of this project is to provide a fun and different way to play Yellow and add more variety to the game, while staying mostly true to the Generation I experience. A gigantic thanks to the pret team for the Pokemon disassemblies as well as the pret community for being helpful and providing tons of tutorials.

## Main Features

- Following Pikachu has been replaced with Following Cramorant! Every sprite, graphic, sound, and text associated with Pikachu has been replaced with Cramorant! Cramorant also has its own movepool, experience growth, and stats loosely based off of those found in Sword/Shield.
- The Pikachu's Beach minigame is now Cramorant's Beach! As long as Cramorant knows Surf, you can play it!
- New exclusive move added for Cramorant.
- Many wild and Trainer Pokemon have had their levels raised slightly in an effort to provide the player with more challenge.
- Journey through the region, beat Team Rocket, collect all badges, catch Pokemon, and become the Champ with Cramorant by your side!

## Additional Features

- Extra Pokemon! Cramorant and 2 other Pokemon have been added which now brings the total up to 154!
- Extra battles! A couple of additional trainers have been added.
- Greater trainer Pokemon variety. Trainers now have a wider selection of Pokemon that they use. Many Pokemon never that never got a chance to shine in battle will do so here!
- Greater wild Pokemon variety! Much more Pokemon can now be found in the wild all across the region or recieved through other means. Many rare Pokemon can now be found in several locations, and Pokemon that couldn't be found in the wild at all are lurking about in the grass!
- All 151+ Pokemon can be obtained in-game without the need for trading! Pikachu is now just a regular Pokemon that can be found in Viridian Forest. Pokemon that evolved through trading can now be obtained a different way, such as Game Corner Prizes! Every Pokemon can essentially be obtained in infinite amounts now.
- New maps added! A few additional locations have been added for new events and dialogue. Many maps have also recieved some touch-ups to look nicer and a few have been altered to be less claustrophobic (Cerulean and Fuschia City) and opened up for easier navigation. Many cut trees have been removed. A few added buildings open up after you become champion.
- Tons of additional items! Check all over for hidden items scattered throughout.
- Many unused, rare, and hard to obtain items have been added and more plentiful than before. If you ever wanted to use Safari Balls outside the Safari Zone, now you can! Speaking of which...
- More forgiving Safari Zone. The amount of steps you are allowed to take has been increased substantially! More Safari Balls are also given to the player and many Safari Zone Pokemon have been made slightly easier to catch!
- Faster saving speed. The game can now be saved much faster than before.
- Faster Fly menu. Scrolling through towns now no longer has a delay! Players can also now fly to the Pokecenters by Mt. Moon and Rock Tunnel!
- Additional flavor text has been added. Several background objects now have dialogue associated with them, such as Red's bed, or the windows in the Vermilion Gym!
- Trapping moves like Wrap are now multi-hit moves instead.
- Additonal text and some grammar touch-ups have been given to various NPC's.
- Vermilion Gym puzzle no longer is frustrating and a time waster.
- Amount of Pokemon required to show to Oak's Aides has been heavily reduced. Get that Flash HM without having to backtrack!
- Beta and unused content included! Some unused music (like Giovanni's theme) and unused graphics and text have been added. A few other themes have been replaced by music adapted from Pokemon Crystal.
- Slow text speed has been removed and replaced by the Normal text speed. Fast text is on by default, and an Instant text speed option has been added! Use this speed to quickly go through dialogue and even skip some sound effects. Perfect for those with limited time.
- Various bug fixes. Many Generation I bugs were fixed in Yellow, while Cramorant Edition fixes a few more minor errors and quirks. Any bugs which provide a negative experience for the player have been patched up.
-Even more incredibly minor stuff that adds more variety to the game.

## Features adapted from other projects and tutorials, many of which can be found in the Wiki section of the pokered and pokeyellow disassemblies.
- Better game corner. Faster and more forgiving slots along with the ability to repeatedly buy coins. (Adapted from Pokemon PureRGB by Vortyne.)
- Repels can now be used immediately after they expire like in modern games! (Included from Pokemon PureRGB.)
- A much better Itemfinder! It is now actually helpful as it points you in the direction of items and tells you if you're standing on them. (Included from Pokemon PureRGB.)
- The left and right d-pad can now be used while shopping to decrease/increase the amount of items by 10. (Included from Pokemon PureRGB.)
- The low health alarm now only beeps a few times before stopping. No need to annoy the player with constant ringing. (Included from Pokemon PureRGB.)
- Pokemon now no longer waste a turn after waking up from sleep, and can attack on the turn they wake up! (Tutorial by Xillicis.)
- Player now turns to face trainers when spotted by them like in other Pokemon games. (Tutorial by JustRegularLuna).
- A move deleter and re-learner have been added which allow you to delete any Pokemon move (including HMs) and learn any moves they've learned previously or from level-up! (Tutorial by PlagueVonKarma.)

## Features not present.
- No physical/special split.
- No seperate Spc. Atk or Spc. Def stats.
- No additional typings.
- No typing changes.
- No movepool changes.
- No base stat changes.
- No sprite changes to existing Pokemon (Although a few misaligned back sprites have been corrected.)

Enjoy and have fun!
